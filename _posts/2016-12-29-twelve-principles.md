[The Agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) is 16 years old by now, definitely not new, but hundreds of companies use Agile principles in their projects. Let's review them:

  1. Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
  2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
  3. Deliver working software frequently.
  4. Daily work between business people and developers
  5. Motivated individuals and trust.
  6. Information to a development team is better with face to face conversations.
  7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
  8. Sustainable development to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
  9. Technical excellence and good design enhances agility
  10. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.
  11. Self organizing teams.
  12. Reflection on how to be more effective, tune, adjust and behave accordingly.

This ideas fits naturally with SOLID design principles. To respond quick to changes is better have our classes well designed, but keeping them simple with only one reason to change and single responsibility.

Here is not explicitly declared, but pair programming is algo a good technique for Agile environments.

The Agile manifesto focus on flat small teams with direct and daily access to core business people to maximize the chances that the software features add real business value by solving and automatizing real business problems.
